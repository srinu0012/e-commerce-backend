E-Commerce Application - React.js Training Project
Objective
The goal of this project is to help trainees learn and apply core React.js concepts by building a fully functional e-commerce application. The application will cover React hooks, lifecycle methods, public/private routing, Zustand store, API calls using Axios, performance optimization, authentication, authorization, and more.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js, React Router, Zustand, Axios
Backend API: DummyJSON (https://dummyjson.com) to begin with later, we will implement APIs in nodejs once we are done with React project
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) frontend authentication to begin with later, we will implement APIs in nodejs
Styling: Material UI (https://mui.com) with Dark mode toggle
State Management: Zustand
Deployment: Github pages
Features Overview

1. User Authentication & Authorization
   User registration & login (JWT-based)
   User should be able to login with mobile/email and password
   Role-based access control (Customer/Admin)
   Store token in local storage/session storage
   Store logged in user profile in Zustand store
   This component should be a popup as user should be able to login from any of the public page.
   Logout functionality
2. Product Listing & Search
   This is a public customer route and default home route
   Fetch products from DummyJSON API, later we will integrate Nodejs APIs
   Display products in a grid layout
   Search products by name/category
   Implement filters (price, category, rating)
   Implement pagination
   On page reload user should stay on this page and filters also should persist
   You can set filters in query parameters
3. Product Details Page
   This is a public customer route
   Take the product id from path parameters
   On page reload user should stay on this page
   Display product information (title, price, description, image, etc.)
   Show related products
   Show and Add reviews & ratings
4. Shopping Cart
   This is a public customer route
   Add/remove items from the cart (using Zustand store)
   Show cart summary (total price, item count)
   On page reload user should stay on this page and see previous cart items
   Handle stock availability
5. Checkout & Order Management
   This is a private customer route. Ask user to login if user not logged in.
   Capture user details (name, address, payment method) (Pre-fill available details)
   Simulated payment process (mock API response)
   Store order details in API/local storage
   Show order confirmation page
6. User Dashboard
   This is a private customer route. Ask user to login if user not logged in.
   View past orders with order status
   Edit profile information
7. Admin Panel
   This is a private admin route. Ask user to login if user not logged in.
   View all orders and update the status of order
8. Performance Optimization
   Lazy loading components using React Suspense
   Memoization using useMemo and useCallback
   Virtualized lists for large product lists
9. Nodejs API Integration
   Implement login API with JWT authentication token.
   Implement middle wares to authenticate all private APIs
   Implement CRUD APIs for Products with role based authentication
   Implement CRUD APIs for Orders with role based authentication
10. Database Integration
    Create PostgreSQL DB.
    Create Users, Products and Orders Tables with best practices.
    Evaluation Criteria
    Code structure, quality & best practices
    Proper use of React hooks & state management
    Performance Optimisation
    Bundle Size
    API integration & error handling
    UI/UX design & responsiveness
    Authentication & Authorization in Reactjs and Nodejs implementation
    Deployment & documentation
